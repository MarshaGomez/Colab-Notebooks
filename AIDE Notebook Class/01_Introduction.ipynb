The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including **training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models**, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including **speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery**.
